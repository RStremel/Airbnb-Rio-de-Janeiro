### Data exploration and analysis of the Airbnb dataset for the city of Rio de Janeiro

* Analysis of price variation between regions and types of accomodation.
* Identification of aspects that can interfere in the price and number of reviews.
* Plotting of graphs and maps showing distribution and correlation between different features.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium

## Steps
* Data cleaning and feature engineering: using `pandas` and `numpy`, checked for missing values, removed irrelevant data, filled nulled values with relevant data, converted data to correct format, treated outliers and created new features based on existing ones.
* Exploratory analysis: used graphical packages such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to find correlations between features and `folium` to show the distribution of available accomodations and price. Some examples of these graphs and maps can be seen below.
* Conclusion: drew some conclusions with the information found that could be useful for anyone trying to rent a place to stay in Rio, or for anyone trying to rent their place.
