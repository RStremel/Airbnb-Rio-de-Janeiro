### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data for Rio de Janeiro to uncover insights about the factors that influence listing prices and build a predictive model to estimate the price of new listings. This can provide valuable information for both hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategy and travelers searching for accommodations within their budget.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium

## Steps
* Data cleaning and feature engineering: using `pandas` and `numpy`, checked for missing values, removed irrelevant data, filled nulled values with relevant data, converted data to correct format, treated outliers and created new features based on existing ones.
* Exploratory analysis: used graphical packages such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to find correlations between features and `folium` to show the distribution of available accomodations and price. Some examples of these graphs and maps can be seen below.
* Conclusion: drew some conclusions with the information found that could be useful for anyone trying to rent a place to stay in Rio, or for anyone trying to rent their place.
